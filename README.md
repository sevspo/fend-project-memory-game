## How to play

To play the game clone or download the project and open it in your borwser. 

## Instructions for students

The starter project had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. We had to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
There are no dependencies in this project and it was written in pure JS.

## Contributing 

Feel free to contribute to my version of the memory game.
